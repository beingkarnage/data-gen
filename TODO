1. tweak config params
    a. "operation": "insertIfEmpty"
        "filter": {
            "lhs" : ["customerType"],
            "rhs" : ["Individuals"],
            "operation" : ["=="],
            "boolean" : []
        }

        both of them having same operation but different meaning and purpose fix that,(0/100)
    b. add shuffle/ random flag in config.

2. the filter obj, could be confusing, convert it to sql query, try duckDB
    -- try using "in" when to check for one to with multiple values
3. replace if-else with neccesary try catches, (0/100)
4. add more strategies (100/100)
    deletion strategy
    replacement strategy
    series/range strategy
5. add more complex relation support ? (0/100)
    --fix relation : support for multiple dtype coomparision, you just have int now
6. maybe if possible think about pre data clean up ? (0/100)
7. explore data generation via, ML libraries.(0/100)
8. add ignore case, while comparing static strings ⬆️(0/100)
9. Out of memory issue, for e.g. multiplying large values in strategy, relations 
    -- heavy memory footprint when generating large number of rows
10. multiple table mapping
    -- Mapping strategy/relation to map one columns to another(0/100)
11. Modularize the script, supply functions defination via, external config (100/100)
12. Code quality:
    remove "strategies/number_range.py", strategy prefix from all of the STRATEGIES.json, as it is already obvious to look into strategies folder.

13. Write unit tests.
14. fix regex strategy, null_mask not used, remove map_to_null
15. config validator, do checks for, null/bad/negative/wrong values
16. optimize unique id generator, fails badly when need to generate large number of uuids,
    --example
        1. this big number, maintaining a set could be pain,
            92840183984919939494 
        2. an id with constant prefix or suffix or both
            HHSF88349S9358898985   
            HHSF88349S93588IIIFD
        3. id with random prefix or suffix or both.


17. intermediate columns which helps in generation of other columns but not involved in final result
