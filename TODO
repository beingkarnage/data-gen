1. tweak config params
    a. "operation": "insertIfEmpty"
        "filter": {
            "lhs" : ["customerType"],
            "rhs" : ["Individuals"],
            "operation" : ["=="],
            "boolean" : []
        }

        both of them having same operation but different meaning and purpose fix that,(0/100)
    b. add shuffle/ random flag in config.

2. the filter obj, could be confusing, convert it to sql query, try duckDB
    -- try using "in" when to check for one to with multiple values
3. replace if-else with neccesary try catches, (0/100)
4. add more strategies (1/100)
    deletion strategy
    replacement strategy
    series/range strategy
5. add more complex relation support ? (0/100)
6. maybe if possible think about pre data clean up ? (0/100)
7. explore data generation via, ML libraries.(0/100)
8. add ignore case, while comparing static strings ⬆️(0/100)
9. Out of memory issue, for e.g. multiplying large values in strategy, relations 
10. Mapping strategy/relation to map one columns to another(0/100)
11. Modularize the script, supply functions defination via, external config (50/100)
